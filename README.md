## This is a template for online experiments that I created for the lab at UCLA and UCR.

There are two folders in this repository:

### (1) sample_experiment
-- Allows the researcher to fit their code into the template to run it and collect data into the database. <br/>
-- Please read the README.md file in the folder itself for instructions on what you need to do to make this work.<br/>

### (2) data_analysis
-- Allows researcher to download the data from the MySQL database and analyze it.<br/>
