## Intro
This is a template for online experiments at both <br>
(1) Consciousness and Metacognition Lab at UCLA, and <br>
(2) Cognition and Neural Computation Lab at UCR. <br> 
This bypasses the use of PsiTurk and interfaces with mTurk directly.<br>

## Credit
Much of the code in this folder is from Jason Carpenter ( https://github.com/jmcarpenter2 ), who kindly shared the code that he wrote with us such that we are able to run experiments online without using PsiTurk. Thank you Jason! <br>

I modified some of Jason's code to make it fit a template form such that others in the lab are able to use it more easily.<br>
